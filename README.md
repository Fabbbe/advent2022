# Advent of Code 2022

This is a repository for my solutions to the 2022 Advent of Code event.

## Languages

I've written these solutions in two different languages, Python (version 3.10) and C (99). Some of the solutions are written in one language and some are written in both.

### Python

Run these how you would any python script:

```
$ python3 <filename>
```

### C

I've tested all the C programs by compiling with gcc's c99 macro:

```
$ c99 -O2 <filename>

...

$ ./a.out
```
